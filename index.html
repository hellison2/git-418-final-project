                    <h2>Learn About Colorado</h2>

                    <p>Colorado has been home to humans for thousands of years. During most of that time, indigenous groups controlled the land. In the late 1500s, Spanish colonists invaded the land and remained in control until the early 1800s. In the 1800s, after a series of expansions and conflicts, Colorado fell under the control of the U.S. It became a state in 1876.</p>

                    <p>Today, Colorado is home to almost 6 million people. The people of Colorado enjoy a high standard of living, most of which are surrounded by beautiful, pristine nature and mountains, making weekend excursions a must for travelers and residents. Popular activities include white water rafting, skiing, hiking, sightseeing, kayaking, and camping.</p>

                <h2>Fun Facts About Colorado</h2>

                <div id="accordion">
                    <h3>Fact #1: Highest paved roads</h3>
                    <p>Colorado is home to the highest paved road in any national park within the United States. The road is called Trail Ridge Road, and it’s located in Rocky Mountain National Park. It passes iconic NP mountains and peaks at 12,183 feet above sea level. But Colorado doesn’t stop there, as the state is also home to the highest paved road in the U.S. Mount Blue Sky Scenic Byway reaches a height of 14,130 feet above sea level.</p>

                    <h3>Fact #2: The mile-high city</h3>
                    <p>Denver is Colorado’s largest city, and it’s nicknamed the mile-high city because its elevation sits at about 5,280 feet or exactly one mile. Elevation can vary depending on where you are in the city, but you can look out for mile-high meters all around to figure out if you’re exactly a mile high or not.</p>

                    <h3>Fact #3: Sand dunes and plains lands</h3>
                    <p>When most people think of Colorado, they imagine the towering mountains and jagged, snowy terrain. However, Colorado is home to some tall sand dunes in Great Sand Dunes National Park. In addition, most of the eastern half of the state looks more similar to Kansas than your mental image of Colorado; there are a ton of empty, vast, great plains.</p>

                    <h3>Fact #4: Myths and legends of the Denver airport</h3>
                    <p>For as long as it’s been around, the Denver airport has been tainted by myths and legends of darkness. Many people are off-put by the strange artwork and statues found within the airport, including the infamous horse statue outside or the gargoyles located in random places. Some people speculate the airport might be some sort of bunker or be home to a secret society. While none of these conspiracy theories have been proven true, they’re still fun to imagine.</p>

                    <h3>Fact #5: Gold rush???</h3>
                    <p>Similar to California, there was also a gold rush in Colorado. Starting in 1858, this short-lived gold rush sparked interest in the state and attracted travelers from all over.</p>
